# <img src="extension/icon.png" alt="logo" width="32" height="32"> Eco-Rating Chrome Extension

A Chrome Extension that analyzes product listings and provides an **Eco-Friendliness Score** based on the materials used in the product. It uses a **LangChain-powered FastAPI backend** to evaluate the sustainability of product components.
>The backend is hosted privately, but the extension is fully functional (buggy though üòÖ, still working on it...)

Works with (so far):
- Amazon
- Flipkart
- Walmart
> ...more coming soon!
